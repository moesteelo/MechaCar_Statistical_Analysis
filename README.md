## **Linear Regression to Predict MPG**

**The multiple linear regression model indicates that three of the six variables have coefficients. Based on these coefficients which indicates that they provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value in the dataset. These three variables are the intercept itself(mpg), vehicle length, and ground clearance**

**Based on the summary of the multiple linear regression the p-value (5.35e-11) is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Also, having a r-squared value of 0.71 meaning a 71% of all mpg predications will be correct when using this linear model. However, it is safe to say that the linear model should not be considered zero since there is sufficient evidence.**
